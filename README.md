## Project Overview

This project is an **individual coursework** developed in **November 2025**.  

This is an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** project focusing on the World Health Organization (WHO) indicator **“Age-standardized prevalence of tobacco use among persons aged 15 years and older.”**

The project aims to gain a deeper understanding of tobacco use as a significant social and public health issue. By analyzing data from **2000 to 2030**, the study explores long-term global trends, gender differences, and country-specific smoking patterns, revealing how tobacco consumption has evolved across regions and populations over time.

### Analysis Focus

- **Global Tobacco Use Trends (2000–2030):**  
  Examined long-term changes in age-standardized tobacco use worldwide, with a focus on overall decline patterns and WHO future projections.

- **Gender Differences in Smoking Behavior:**  
  Compared tobacco use prevalence between males and females, highlighting persistent gender gaps and changes over time.

- **Country-Level Distribution & Inequality:**  
  Analyzed the distribution of smoking rates across countries using boxplots to identify outliers, regional disparities, and convergence trends.

- **Smoking Level Classification Over Time:**  
  Investigated shifts in country classifications (Low, Medium, High, Very High tobacco use) across key years (2000, 2010, 2020, 2030).

- **Outliers & Special Cases:**  
  Identified exceptional cases (e.g., extreme gender gaps or zero reported values) to discuss the influence of cultural, political, and data-reporting factors on public health statistics.
